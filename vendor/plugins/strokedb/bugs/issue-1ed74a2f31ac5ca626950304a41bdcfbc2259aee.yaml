title: "Consider adding Meta#includes (or #implements)"
desc: |-
  The idea is you might want to create your own meta which includes behaviour of few others. So, for example,
  you want to introduce User meta, which should include Timestampable meta behaviour, but you will have no need concatenating them all time
  (like User+Timestampable)
