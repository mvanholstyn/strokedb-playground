  - The main problem is that it fails randomly (not each time you run specs)

  - Spec is located at spec/lib/strokedb/sync/store_sync_spec.rb now
- - 2008-04-20 13:10:54.668785 Z
  - Yurii Rashkovskii <yrashk@idbns.com>
  - closed issue with disposition fixed
  - That appears to be a spec bug (store was not synced, and autosync was trying to sync everything on files already engaged in the next subsequent example)
- - 2008-04-27 05:51:35.607192 Z
  - Yurii Rashkovskii <yrashk@idbns.com>
  - changed status from closed to in_progress
  - It appears that it still fails sometimes.
