title: LMA is not functioning properly
desc: |-
  Spec appears to be weak -- I experience problems with LMA on new-storages branch.
  After looking into its implementation and comparing with original LMA it appears that they have different behaviour.
  Also I should mention that implementation of things like [] isn't really lazy.
