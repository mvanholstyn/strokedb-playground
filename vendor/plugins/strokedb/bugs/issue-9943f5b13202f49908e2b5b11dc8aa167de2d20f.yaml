title: validates_associated doesn't play well with has_many association
desc: |-
  You can't add an invalid document as an associate.
  Also if serialized associate is valid, but in-memory document isn't valid, valid? returns true.

    I assume that behaviour we have experienced is quite valid. Here are two scenarios:
    1) we push invalid document to has_many association
    InvalidDocumentError will be raised right away, so there is nothing validates_associated can do
    2) we push valid document to has_many association and then update it so it becomes invalid
    again I think there is nothing validates_associated can do, since has_many deals with saved documents and that
    invalid document is unsaved after all and only old valid version is available through has_many
    
    Dixi. Any objections?
