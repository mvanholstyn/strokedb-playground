  # ChunkedSkiplist (CS) implements a distributed, concurrently accessible 
  # skiplist using SimpleSkiplist (SL) as building blocks.
  # Each instance contains a single instance of SimpleSkiplist.
  # Higher-level CS store references to lower-level SL as SL "data".
  # Lowest-level CS contains actual data.
  #
  # Regular state of the chunks (square brackets denote references): 
  #
  #                   ______        ___________________      
  #                 /        \    /                     \
  #    HEAD -> C1[ C2, C3 ], C2[ C4, C5 ], C3[ C6, C7 ], C4[data], ...
  # =>                  \__________________/
  #
  # Initial state is a single lowest-level chunk:
  # 
  #    HEAD -> C1[data]
  # 
  # When higher-level node is inserted, new skiplist is created.
  # Old skiplist is moved to a new chunk, current chunk uppers its level.
  #
  # ASYNCHRONOUS CONCURRENT INSERT
  #
  # SKiplists, by their nature, allow you to concurrently insert and
  # delete nodes. However, very little number of nodes must be locked
  # during update. In our implementation, we lock a whole chunk if it is
  # modified. Higher-level chunks are modified rarely, so they are not 
  # locked most of the time. Different chunks could be updated concurrently.
  # Read-only concurrent access is always possible no matter what nodes are  
  # locked for modification.
  #
  # ChunkedSkiplist has an API for asynchronous data access useful for
  # cÃ¶operative multitasking, but it is also thread-safe for preemtive
  # multitasking, which is kinda nice feature, but is not to be evaluated
  # in a real-world applications.
  #
  # Chunked #find
  # 
  # Find may return an actual data or a reference to lower-level chunk.
  # It is a networking wrapper business to do interpret the result of #find.
  #
  # Insert is harder =) When new node level is higher than data chunk level
  # we have to insert into proxy chunk and create all the levels of proxy 
  # chunks down to the data chunk. If node level is low, we just insert 
  # node into appropriate data chunk.
  # The hard part about it are locking issues during insertion.
