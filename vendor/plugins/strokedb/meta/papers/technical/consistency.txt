CONSISTENCY MODELS

In a distributed system it's extremely hard to support storage consistency, 
but it's possible to support client consistency.

There're 4 flavors of client consistency:

1) Monotonic read consistency: if process reads a value of X, next reads will
                               return that value, or later value.
2) Monotonic write: every write operation to X happens before every next write
                    operations to X.
3) Your-writes consistency: write operation to X always visible to further
                            reads from X.
4) Write-follow-reads consistency: write next to the read of X always happens
                                   with just read or later value of X.
                                   
It should be possible to support all 4 models. To accomplish this, we have to 
manipulate with versions, diffs and timestamps.
